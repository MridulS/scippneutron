    "  This may be zero if the full pulse length is used, but choppers such as resolution choppers may extract a section of the pulse that is not aligned with the start of the full pulse.\n",
    "  This offset can also be used to take into account a potential difference between the timing system's definition of the pulse time and the actual beginning of the neutron pulse exiting, e.g., the moderator.\n",

    "For every event recorded in a detector, `event_time_offset` ($\\Delta t$) in an `NXevent_data` group is the offset from the latest (previous) `event_time_zero` ($T_0^j$), i.e., the time difference to the previous vertical dotted line.\n",

Overview: scipp-neutron
=======================

``neutron`` builds on top of ``scipp`` and provides features specific to handling and reducing data generated in neutron scattering facilities.
A key example is "unit conversion", e.g., from time-of-flight to energy transfer in an inelastic neutron scattering experiment at a spallation-based neutron source.

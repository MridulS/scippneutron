# Approximation of L_2 for gravity correction

The file `gravity_approx.typ` contains a derivation and description of the approximation used in `scattering_angles_with_gravity`.
It can be rendered using [typst](https://typst.app/):
```shell
typst compile gravity_approx.typ
```
But it should be readable as is.
